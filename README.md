# Cut The Fluff (for Obsidian)

![Screenshot](assets/screenshot.png)

Great writing is clear and concise. Cut the Fluff helps you edit by pointing out potentially unnecessary words or complexity. 

Examples:

* **Weak Qualifiers & Hedges** (eg. ~~quite~~, ~~basically~~, ~~very~~, ~~really~~)
* **ClichÃ©s, jargon and metaphors** (eg. ~~move the needle~~, ~~double-edged sword~~, ~~at the end of the day~~)
* **Unnecessary complexity or clutter** (eg. ~~utilise~~ -> use, ~~in regard to~~ -> about, ~~it is interesting to note~~)
* **Redundancies** (~~each and~~ every, ~~one and~~ the same, ~~final~~ conclusion, combine ~~together~~)
